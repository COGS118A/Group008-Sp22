A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better.

    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our project focuses on attempting to predict both a hotel's average score based on their reviews. We will be utilizing “515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe” from Kaggle. This dataset contains 515,000 reviews from 1493 different hotels and contains the review which separated by the positive and negative portions, the number word count of the positive and negative portion respectively, locations of hotel, days since the review. In addition, we will be doing sentiment analysis within the positive and negative portions to get the degree of the positivity and negativity.After the sentiment analysis we will be testing different models(OLS, K-Nearest Neighbor, etc) and determining which model has the highest accuracy. \n"

    "# Background\n",
    "Beyond location, price, and amenities, consumers judge their perception on a possible hotel to stay out based on the experience “or reviews” of previous guests. For example, according to TripAdvisor, a site for hotel and restaurant reviews and booking, roughly 81% of people always or frequently check a hotel’s reviews before booking <a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>]. However, not all reviews and experiences are weighted equally. According to Sparks, B.A, and Browning, noticed that how information is framed within the review as well as the the focus of the review itself makes the biggest difference in how much a review would affect the overall view of a hotel  <a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>]. This begs the question on whether a computer can take a look at these reviews and determine the trust(in the form of ratings) that a hotel has in a similar way to how humans prioritze certain ideas, information, and looking at the overall sentiments.. Sentiment analysis, the ability of extracting emotion, feeling, and other subjective states, has been used on a wide arrangement of different reviews from movies on Netflix to restaurant reviews <a name=\"sotanote\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>]. However, most work on reviews ends with extracting the overall positivity or negativity of the review, not seeing if we can predict or gain insight on the overall view or rating of the hotel, movie, or other thing being reviewed. \n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly describe the problem that you are solving. Avoid ambiguous words. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one ML-relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms), measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once)."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the dataset [515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe\n",
    "](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe) from the repository Kaggle and generated by the user Jianshen Liu. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 515000 reviews of 1493 hotels throughout Europe, it was collected from the hotel booking website [booking](www.booking.com). It has 17 features, and some very useful are the average score, hotel name, geographical latitude,nationality of the  geographical longitude, days since the review, negative word counts, and positive word counts.\n",

    "Each single observation contains one customer review with all the features. Despite the data being clean and with no missing values,we need to process the review text such that we have a quantifiable metric.\n"

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Our proposed solution to predicting a hotel’s average score and an individual’s score of a hotel will have multiple parts: Preprocessing, data cleaning, sentiment analysis of written reviews, determining the best classifier for predicting scores, and finally, training, testing, and evaluation. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, here are the libraries we plan on using. <br>\n",
    "import numpy as np<br>\n",
    "import pandas as pd<br>\n",
    "from nltk.corpus import stopwords<br>\n",
    "from wordcloud import STOPWORDS<br>\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>\n",
    "import string<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To preprocess and clean our data we have to remove any entries with missing values as well as remove those that correspond to reviewers who did not write out reviews and instead only gave numerical scores. Since we plan on using sentiment analysis to classify the written reviews, we need to remove the entries that did not provide any additional information aside from a score. We then need to remove any columns that correspond to features we do not need. <br>\n",
    "Thus, the variables we plan on using are: <br>\n",
    "the review date<br>\n",
    "the average hotel score<br>\n",
    "hotel name<br>\n",
    "reviewer nationality<br>\n",
    "negative review <br>\n",
    "positive review<br>\n",
    "the number of reviews the reviewer has given in the past<br>\n",
    "total number of valid reviews that the hotel has<br>\n",
    "tags the reviewer has given the hotel. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews we must perform some text cleaning. Namely, getting rid of stopwords, punctuation, and converting all letters to lowercase. We plan on performing a sentiment classification on the written reviews that will make the data quantitatively easier to put into our hotel rating prediction classifier. One way we can perform sentiment classification on the reviews is through using logistic regression to determine how positive or negative a review is. \n",
    "Next, we want to determine a classification model that would best predict the hotel ratings. The specific input we plan on using in this model are the nine variables listed above. Some potential models we could use include OLS and KNN. For instance, we went with KNN we could use the ten closest neighbors and find the mean score of them.  \n",
    "To split our data into train and test sets, we will use 80% for training and 20% for testing, choosing what entry goes into which set randomly. Once we train our model we will test it, run our evaluation metrics, and plot our results using Matplotlib. \n"

   "source": [
    "Before beginning this project, our team has acknowledged potential ethics and privacy concerns that may arise from our data and implementation. Primarily, it is important to note that the dataset we plan on using is legally obtained as it is data from Booking.com that has been made publicly available. We discovered this specific collection of data from Kaggle.com, posted by Jiashen Liu who curated the dataset and made it available to the public domain to copy and modify as we intend to do. \n",
    "It is also important to acknowledge the potential biases in the dataset. Most notably, each data entry includes the nationality of the user which is one of the many various features provided by the dataset that we can use to predict the user’s score of the hotel. We take this into consideration as it can result in a potential bias in our predictions. \n",
    "Our team has also taken into consideration the privacy of the responders and has assured that the privacy of all reviewers is upheld as there are no identifying personal features other than the reviewer’s nationality. However, though there may be personal information in specific written reviews, all information was freely given by the individual. Thus, the anonymity of individuals is maintained. One way we can address these ethical and privacy concerns is through using an ethics checklist that addresses important ethical considerations in data collection, modeling, and analysis. A useful tool we can use to add such a checklist to our project is the command line tool, Deon. \n"
